# ARTIMELINE

ARTIMELINE displays artwork from around the world created during a selected time period. Use this app to place familiar works and artists in their historical contexts, and see art and styles from around the world that you might not be familiar with (yet). For example, you might recognize the work of Impressionist painters in Europe and the United States during the late 1800s, and ARTIMELINE can show you what other artists were creating at the same time, in a variety of media.

Enter a year range in the Search panel to generate a selection of random artwork from theÂ [Art Institute of Chicago's](https://www.artic.edu/) collection. Optionally, you can focus your search on specific media.

Note: years from -2000 (2000 BC) to 1950 can be used for a search. Earlier artwork isn't typically attributed to a single year, and later artwork isn't typically in the public domain; in either case, they won't appear in API search results.

The site uses the [Art Institute's Public API](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api), the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), and React. Work on this project is ongoing, but a version is deployed at [artimeline.netlify.app](https://artimeline.netlify.app/).
