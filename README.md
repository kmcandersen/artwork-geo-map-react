# ARTIMELINE

This site lets users enter a year range and view the map location and details of a selection of random artwork from those years. Users can place familiar works and artists in their historical context, and be introduced to art and styles from around the world that they might not be familiar with.

All artwork displayed is from the collection of the [Art Institute of Chicago](https://www.artic.edu/) and images are in the public domain. The site uses the [Art Institute's Public API](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api), the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), and React.
